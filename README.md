Hereâ€™s a Python script that uses the qrcode library to create a QR code generator with options for custom size and color. I've included detailed comments to explain each line of code.

Install Required Library
Before running the code, ensure you have the qrcode and Pillow libraries installed. You can install them using:

pip install qrcode[pil]
